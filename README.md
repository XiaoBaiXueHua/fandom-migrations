# fandom-migrations
tracking how fandoms shift between fic posting platforms via wayback machine and spreadsheets.

This project was started because I kept seeing people say that anime/manga fandom was like, a totally different sphere from the ~Western Media Fandoms~ that hung out on livejournal and eventually bore AO3

## fandoms chosen:

### anime

| Name | Manga Run | Anime Start | Reason for Inclusion |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Known for having a lot of scattered personal archive websites, and was hit hard by FFN purges.                                                                                                                                           |
| CardCaptor Sakura   | May 1996 -- Jun 2000        | 17 Jun 2000 (EN dub)                                                                   | Another first anime for many people in the west. Has a huge repository on FFN, but for unknown reasons, has not been carried over to AO3. |
| Prince of Tennis    | 19 Jul 1999 -- 3 Mar 2008   | 10 Oct 2001 (JP orig)   :---:  24 Apr 2007 (EN dub?)                                   | For reasons currently unknown, it was one of The biggest anime fandoms on AO3 at its start, and is currently suspected to be an early cause for sports anime historically having a greater presence on the site, thus eventually leading to the greater animanga fandom shift to the site years later.  |
| Naruto              | 21 Sept 1999 -- 10 Nov 2014 | 10 Sept 2005 (EN dub, original)  :---:  2 Jan 2009 (EN dub, Shippuden)                 | Old fandom that predates AO3, and, *crucially*, was absolutely fuckoff massive and mainstream for many, many years.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Fruits Basket       | 18 Jul 1998 -- 20 Nov 2006  | 29 Oct 2002 -- 27 May 2003 (EN, orig)    :---:   6 April 2019 -- 29 June 2021 (Remake) | Popular old shoujo with a lot of fic in its heyday that never got transferred over to AO3, and also got a remake in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Fullmetal Alchemist | 12 Jul 2001 -- 11 Jun 2010  | 6 Nov 2004 (EN, orig)   :---:   5 Apr 2009 -- 4 Jul 2010 (Both, Brotherhood)           | Popular old shounen with a fandom that lasted many, many years and is still active to this day.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, the fandom remains a little active still.                                                                                            |
| Fairy Tail          | 2 Aug 2006 -- 26 Jul 2017   | 12 Oct 2009 -- 29 Sept 2019 (JP, EN 2 years after)                                     | Popular long-running shounen that, while existent before AO3, did not get too big until 2012-2013; yet, most of its archives are still on FFN.                                                                                                                                                          |

It was Weeby, yet everywhere in fandom at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Blue Exorcist       | 4 Apr 2009 -- present       | 17 Apr 2011 -- 2 Oct 2011                                                              | In trying to bridge the release gap between Hetalia and SnK, I needed to find an anime that aired in 2011. This was the shounen pick.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Madoka              | :N/A:                       | 7 Jan 2011 -- 21 Apr 2011                                                              | Again, trying to bridge the Hetalia-SnK release gap bc trying to puzzle together how newer anime were starting to take hold on AO3 in that particular period was hard. This was the shoujo pick.                                                                                                        |
| Shingeki no Kyojin  | 9 Sept 2009 -- 9 Apr 2021   | 7 Apr 2013 -- present                                                                  | \* takes a long drag of an imaginary cigarette \* As a SuperMassive Fandom that peaked in Tumblr's heyday and has since become Cringe(tm), yet mainstream, as well as one of The starter animes for new weebs of a new generation, I kind of legally had to pick it lol. Also, I was There for a while. |
| Haikyuu!!           | 20 Feb 2012 -- 20 Jul 2020  | 6 Apr 2014 -- 19 Dec 2020                                                              | I didn't wanna pick HQ at first, but during my SnK days, I always thought it was odd that HQ was so popular on AO3, yet had hardly anything on FFN. Now, I suspect it catalyzed the animanga fic community's migration to AO3.                                                                          |
| My Hero Academia    | 7 Jul 2014 -- present       | 3 Apr 2016 -- present                                                                  | \* takes another long drag of an imaginary cigarette \* As the Next Generation SuperHuge long-running shounen, a fandom that has broken into The Mainstream, and as a former member of this fandom myself. I'm kind of legally obligated to track it.                                                   |
