# fandom-migrations
tracking how fandoms shift between fic posting platforms via wayback machine and spreadsheets.

This project was started because I kept seeing people say that anime/manga fandom was like, a totally different sphere from the `~Western Media Fandoms~` that hung out on livejournal and eventually bore AO3.

Anyway, if you want the raw data, we have the `.Master CSV` folder with a bunch of csv files exported from the `Master Data Harvest.ods` file, where four times a year, I go to all these various fanfiction archives to type in the data I'm gathering with my wretched little HANDS i do SO much of this by hand orz. Not as much as I used to (see the `qol-userscripts` folder) but still. Anyway the csvs are separated by **SEMICOLONS** so if you're gonna import that for a project um. Watch out!

## fandoms chosen:

_**Last Modified:** 8 May 2023_

- as of this moment, only anime and tv show fandoms are really finalized, as i haven't yet gotten to collecting that much data for other fandom groups, esp since like every project i've ever made, this one keeps spiralling into something more n more elaborate lmao

### anime

Has a huge repository on FFN, but for unknown reasons, has not been carried over to AO3.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Prince of Tennis    | 19 Jul 1999 -- 3 Mar 2008   | 10 Oct 2001 (JP orig)   :---:  24 Apr 2007 (EN dub?)                                   | For reasons currently unknown, it was one of The biggest anime fandoms on AO3 at its start, and is currently suspected to be an early cause for sports anime historically having a greater presence on the site, thus eventually leading to the greater animanga fandom shift to the site years later.  |
| Naruto              | 21 Sept 1999 -- 10 Nov 2014 | 10 Sept 2005 (EN dub, original)  :---:  2 Jan 2009 (EN dub, Shippuden)                 | Old fandom that predates AO3, and, *crucially*, was absolutely fuckoff massive and mainstream for many, many years.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Fullmetal Alchemist | 12 Jul 2001 -- 11 Jun 2010  | 6 Nov 2004 (EN, orig)   :---:   5 Apr 2009 -- 4 Jul 2010 (Both, Brotherhood)           | Popular old shounen with a fandom that lasted many, many years and is still active to this day.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, the fandom remains a little active still.                                                                                            |
| Fairy Tail          | 2 Aug 2006 -- 26 Jul 2017   | 12 Oct 2009 -- 29 Sept 2019 (JP, EN 2 years after)                                     | Popular long-running shounen that, while existent before AO3, did not get too big until 2012-2013; yet, most of its archives are still on FFN.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Hetalia             | 2006 -- Present             | 24 Jan 2009 -- 2 Oct 2015; 1 Apr 2021 -- 17 Jun 2021                                   | SuperMassive "Fandom That Ate Fandom" that was *very critically* born in 2009. It was Weeby, yet everywhere in fandom at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Blue Exorcist       | 4 Apr 2009 -- present       | 17 Apr 2011 -- 2 Oct 2011                                                              | In trying to bridge the release gap between Hetalia and SnK, I needed to find an anime that aired in 2011. This was the shounen pick.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Madoka              | :N/A:                       | 7 Jan 2011 -- 21 Apr 2011                                                              | Again, trying to bridge the Hetalia-SnK release gap bc trying to puzzle together how newer anime were starting to take hold on AO3 in that particular period was hard. This was the shoujo pick.                                                                                                        |
| Shingeki no Kyojin  | 9 Sept 2009 -- 9 Apr 2021   | 7 Apr 2013 -- present                                                                  | \* takes a long drag of an imaginary cigarette \* As a SuperMassive Fandom that peaked in Tumblr's heyday and has since become Cringe(tm), yet mainstream, as well as one of The starter animes for new weebs of a new generation, I kind of legally had to pick it lol. Also, I was There for a while. |
| Haikyuu!!           | 20 Feb 2012 -- 20 Jul 2020  | 6 Apr 2014 -- 19 Dec 2020                                                              | I didn't wanna pick HQ at first, but during my SnK days, I always thought it was odd that HQ was so popular on AO3, yet had hardly anything on FFN. Now, I suspect it catalyzed the animanga fic community's migration to AO3.                                                                          |
| My Hero Academia    | 7 Jul 2014 -- present       | 3 Apr 2016 -- present                                                                  | \* takes another long drag of an imaginary cigarette \* As the Next Generation SuperHuge long-running shounen, a fandom that has broken into The Mainstream, and as a former member of this fandom myself. I'm kind of legally obligated to track it.                                                   |

### TV Shows

| Name                     | Air Period                                                               | Reason for Inclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supernatural             | 13 Sept 2005 -- 19 Nov 2020                                              | The "Super" in SuperWhoLock, I wanna say it's basically the American equivalent of a long-running shounen series like *One Piece*.                                                                                                                               |
| Doctor Who               | 1963 -- 1989; 2005 -- present                                            | The "Who" in SuperWhoLock. Admittedly only chosen because SuperWhoLock was one of the only big Western fandoms I could think of at the start of this project.                                                                                                    |
| Sherlock (TV)            | 25 Jul 2010 -- 15 Jan 2017                                               | The "Lock" in SuperWhoLock. At first, only included because of SuperWhoLock, but then a friend told me that when she entered fandom in 2014 for Sherlock, everything was already all-AO3, very unlike my observations of the animanga shifts.                    |
| Glee                     | 19 May 2009 -- 20 Mar 2015                                               | Apparently it was Huge back in its heyday, and was full of discourse on Tumblr. Seemingly weathered the LJ-Tumblr migration, then was dead in the water by 2013, and the vast majority of fic is left to rot on FFN.                                             |
| Once Upon a Time         | 23 Oct 2011 -- 18 May 2018                                               | I think it was, like, on a list of "Fandoms That Ate Fandom" ("FTAF") on Fanlore, or it was just really high up on FFN.                                                                                                                                          |
| Buffy the Vampire Slayer | 10 Mar 1997 -- 20 May 2003                                               | Huge franchise, apparently, with a lot a lot of fanfiction on FFN, so I ended up including it because I saw its numbers ballooning as I was first taking FFN TV data. Honestly not too familiar with it otherwise.                                               |
| Merlin                   | 20 Sept 2008 -- 24 Dec 2012                                              | According to Fanlore.org, a FTAF. Also, it was born and had its canon releasing at a critical age for AO3.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Teen Wolf                | 5 Jun 2011 -- 24 Sept 2017                                               | Similar reasons to Merlin, except that it lasted longer, and in reading about SPN drama, I kept seeing people mention "Sterek" drama.                                                                                                                            |
| Star Trek                | 8 Sept 1966 -- present                                                   | Admittedly, I somehow forgot about the Mother Of Modern Fandom, Star Trek when initially picking fandoms for this project, but the tenacity of little old ladies is truly remarkable.                                                                            |
| Stargate                 | 27 Jul 1997 -- 9 May 2011                                                | \*"Was anyone going to tell me that the Stargate TV series is a sequel to a 1994 movie titled *Stargate* or was I just supposed to find that out reading the Wikipedia page for the fandom myself just now" meme\*. Anyway, another "FTAF" according to Fanlore. |
| The Walking Dead         | 31 Oct 2010 -- 20 Nov 2022                                               | Before starting this project, I kept seeing people attribute the popularity of shows like TWD and the general early 2010s zombie apocalypse media boom to the rise of SnK and thought it relevant as a result.                                                   |
| The X-Files              | 10 Sept 1993 -- 19 May 2002 (orig); 24 Jan 2016 -- 21 Mar 2018 (revival) | Not only a major fandom from the 90s, but one of its oldest, largest, most inclusive historical archives, gossamer.org, is still up. Although defunct, its data is also included.                                                                                |

### Video Games

| Name              | First Release                       | Reason for Inclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pokémon           | 1996                                | Not only was Pokémon like The SuperMassive Thing from the day it came out,  but a lot of my friends were initially introduced to fandom via Pokémon forums.  As such, I think it goes without saying that Pokémon is an extremely important  part of this fannish puzzle.         |
| Final Fantasy     | 18 Dec 1987 (I);  31 Jan 1997 (VII) | (VII is also noted because that's the one that was most important to fujoshi,  from what I've gathered.) Anyway, this game was huge and kept showing  up when I was first gathering Pokémon data, and also apparently, it was a   very important work to fujoshi back in the day. |
| Undertale         | 15 Sept 2015                        | UT was a lot of people's first fandom, I feel. Also the AU spinoff stuff was insane.   I saw some of the fandom firsthand, but it's hard for me to parse the importance  of that because I was very, very new to Tumblr at the time.   |
| League of Legends | 27 Oct 2009                         | I know League itself is more about the gaming than the storytelling and fandom  (to my knowledge anyway), but I wanna see if the release of *Arcane* did  anything here.                                                                                                          |
| Legend of Zelda   | 21 Feb 1986                         | It was also on the top of the list for video game fandoms on FFN. I suspect it's the ZeLink.   |
| Kingdom Hearts    | 28 Mar 2002                         | It was Big, it had a lot of Story being Told and fic which could be written after. I  wasn't gonna include it at first, but then I remembered reading some KH fic  despite not being into KH, so I was like, "eh might as well."   |
| Sonic             | 1991                                | I wasn't gonna include it at first, but then I kept getting reminders of how absolutely  Pivotal MLP and Sonic were to young furries growing up (and how Massive the  fandom had been on DeviantArt especially), and I gave in.    |

### Cartoons

It had a lot going on on LJ, and  continues to be beloved to this day, and was born and had canon  releasing all the way up to around Strikethrough.                                                                                                                               |

Also, *critically*, it had (and still has) its  own fandom-specific fanfic archive, which to this day remains  The place for MLP fic. When considering other spaces like Equestria  Daily, it becomes very clear that MLP is a living fossil of early  2000s fandom ecosystem.                       |
| Miraculous Ladybug         | **19 Oct 2015 -- present**                                                          | A large, modern fandom I was also a part of for a while, and  which remains very active to this day, considering it's still being  released. When looking for fic of it at first, I was very surprised  that FFN had much less fic compared to AO3 at the time.                                                                                                                        |

| Voltron                    | **1984 -- 2012**  (first three iterations);  **2016 -- 2018**  (Legendary Defender) | Famously huge, famously discourseful, and allegedly The Source  of modern Anti-vs-Proship Fandom Discourse, it was my very first  tip-off of historical FFN/AO3 differences when I checked FFN and  was shocked to find *incredibly little* VLD fic there.                                                                                                                             |

Fizzled out quicker than I expected, though,  but we can't always be picking winners.                                                                                                                                     |

Since my sister was obsessed w/it  for a while, figured I might as well include it. Plus, canon romance  with action-packed stories always attract loving fandoms.                                                                                                                |

Plus, it  was born at a pretty critical time for AO3, yet was aimed at  children, who were more likely to use/check FFN first. |

Anyway, HS is everywhere,  and it would be remiss of me to exclude it. |
