Life was not kind, and hope was not a strong enough shield to defend against its blades.
This is one of the three facts of the universe that so many kids are forced to learn early, that so many adults enforce unknowingly. Not all men are created equal, hope cannot be a shield, and everything must end one day. Truths that can’t be unlearned, truths that rule over the less fortunate while lifting up the lucky.
But like the third fact states, everything will meet its end, even the facts and truths that have lasted since the beginning of time. And sometimes, it just takes one boy to take it all down…
